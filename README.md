## Simplex

This project implements a Simplex Calculator using the traditional simplex algorithm. The simplex algorithm is used to solve linear optimization problems in which we are given a set of n-dimensional inequalities (has n variables) that act as constraints for some formula of which we would like to optimize.

Below is information about the traditional simplex algorithm and linear optimizaiton problems:
