## Simplex

This project implements a Simplex Calculator using the traditional simplex algorithm. The simplex algorithm is used to solve linear optimization problems in which we are given a set of n-dimensional inequalities (has n variables) that act as constraints for some formula of which we would like to optimize.

A common way to use the simplex algorithm is by constructing a tableau and then following a set of steps. This is the approach that my algorithm takes where the tableau is represented as an n-dimensional list in Python.

Below is information about the traditional simplex algorithm and linear optimization problems:

Along with the backend included in this repo, I also included a simple user interface written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The Frontend communicates with the Backend via Flask. Both the Backend and Frontend are deployed on Heroku.

Below is the Git Repo for the User Interface:
